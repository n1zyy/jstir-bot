# jstir-bot

This is a stupid little cinch bot. Its primary purpose is to yell at people who spell 'OpenStack' wrong, but it has also grown the ability to halibut-slap people and to post things to Twitter (with zero error-checking code).

People argued about whether I should release it under the WTFPL or the Rude Software License, so I compromised on WTFPL with rude commit messages.
